# Light-Pollution-Project
SDM Final Project

The study focusses on determining the influence that human economic, social and commercial activity has on Light Pollution

Many factors that involve our changing lifestyles, industrial revolution, around the clock manufacturing and workforce culture, nightlife and recreation, our complex transport and energy infrastructure contribute towards Light Pollution”

The intention was to study this phenomenon by factoring in variables that represent economic activity, transport and energy usage.

# INPUTS
The input files used for analysis are -
GDP.csv, Electricity_Normalized.csv, Vehicle_Normalized.csv, Population_Normalized.csv, LightPoll.csv

Variables considered for the study represent human activities such as economical, transportation and energy consumption - 
#GDP per Capita → Represents the activities and ability of a nation to keep the economic, commercial and social engine running which have caused sweeping changes in our lifestyles, work habits and recreational and leisure activities.

#Electricity Consumption → The consumption of electricity for domestic and industrial purposes for different purposes, of which lighting and illuminating is one.

#Vehicle Sale → The sale of motor vehicles that represents the biggest fraction of our transportation system.
#Radiance → The magnitude of light pollution is measured using this parameter that factors in the population and the area of a country. 

The data for these contributing variables were collected from reliable international resources for the years 2012-2015

Final merged data used for analysis is in the file named - FinalData_Exported.csv
